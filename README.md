# Scraping-Table
this is how I took info from a table on a website and inserted it into SQL

The site I took from is https://fantasydata.com/nfl-stats/fantasy-football-weekly-projections.aspx?fs=1&stype=0&sn=0&scope=0&w=-1&ew=-1&s=&t=0&p=0&st=FantasyPointsPPR&d=1&ls=&live=false&pid=false&minsnaps=4


Here is the fiddle.
